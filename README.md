Hello :3

I'm Speykious. Aside from being huge weeb and rhythm games enthusiast, I'm a software developer and I love making software from scratch.
I hate bloated software and think that any decent software these days should load instantaneously and that software nowadays is way too slow >:v
So for anything I do I aim for it to feel actually responsive, while also not consuming all your RAM and CPU.
Oh and quite importantly, to *not look like shit*. Making rectangles pretty doesn't necessarily demand more resources!

My favorite programming languages are Rust first, C# second and Haskell third.
Although I'm currently re-exploring C to learn about allocators and alternative allocation strategies.
